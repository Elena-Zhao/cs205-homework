1. Method description:

In my approach, the threads can begin an iteration asynchronously by only checking
whether threads n, n - 1, n + 1 have completed iteration i - 1 without waiting for any other threads to complete iteration i-1.
Here I used an M * N matrix, where M is the number of threads and N is the number
of iterations, and each element stores a threading.Event object which is used to manage whether the iteration n of thread m has completed.

Before calling filtering.median_3x3() in iteration i, thread thn wait() until events_matrix[i - 1][thn - 1],
events_matrix[i - 1][thn], events_matrix[i - 1][thn + 1] has been set(). After the execution of filtering.median_3x3(),
call events_matrix[i][thn].set() to unblock next round of iteration.
